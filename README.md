Xpensio is a React Native app that aims to help people keep track of their expenses. It was inspired by the prevailing cost of living crisis in our economy, and we thought it would be a great way to empower people to keep track of their everyday spending and improve their financial health.

Users can add expenses, scan their receipts, and get a detailed breakdown of their spending through our analysis charts and maps.
